# Top 10 list Week 09

1. [GPT vs MBR](https://www.howtogeek.com/193669/whats-the-difference-between-gpt-and-mbr-when-partitioning-a-drive/)<br>
GPT is a relatively newer version of MBR. GPT is often used in computers nowadays as it is compatible with UEFI. I chose this topic because I would like to know how they could differ. I chose this website because it is straightforward and therefore easy to understand.


2. [Advantages and Disadvantages of Disk Partition](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/partition-hard-drive-explained/)<br>
There are advantages and disadvantages of disk partitioning. Advantages include Ease of OS Reinstallation, Simpler Backups, (Potentially) Improved Security, Better File Organization. One major disadvantage is Complexity and Chances for Errors. I chose this topic because I would like to know how it could come as both a an advantage and disadvantage. I chose this website because it is straightforward and therefore easy to understand.


3. [Systemctl](https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/what-is-systemctl-an-in-depth-overview/)<br>
Systemctl is a function responsible for systemd and service manager. It is used to manage servers in services. I chose this topic because I would to know how it could be used. I chose this website because it is straightforward and therefore easy to understand.


4. [Disk Scheduling](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/disk-scheduling-algorithms/)<br>
Disk scheduling is used to order the inputs and outputs of requests for a disk. It is useful because sometimes a disk controller can only serve one I/O request. I chose this topic because I would to know why it is important and how the process works. I chose this website because it is straightforward and therefore easy to understand.


5. [Storage Management](https://www.pcwdld.com/storage-management)<br>
Storage management is used to maximize the efficiency of data storage resources. It has several techniques like Performance, Capacity, Recoverability, and Availability. I chose this topic because I would to know how it could be an advantage and how the process works. I chose this website because it is straightforward and therefore easy to understand.

6. [Swap Space](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/swap-space-management-in-operating-system/)<br>
Swapping means to increase the processes during process sharing in the CPU. Swap space itself is an area on a disk where the processes that are swapped out. I chose this topic because I would to know when it could be done. I chose this website because it is straightforward and therefore easy to understand.


7. [Firmware dan Software](https://superuser.com/questions/299391/what-are-the-differences-between-firmware-and-software-os)<br>
Firmware is a CPU code in the ROM that helps to load an OS. Firmwares contain basic functions of a device and could provice services to softwares that are higher in level. I chose this topic because I would to know how they relate. I chose this website because it is straightforward and therefore easy to understand.


8. [Bootloader](https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/server/configuration/what-is-a-bootloader/)<br>
A bootloader is also called a bootstrap loader. It is a software that loads to the memory when a computer is turned on so the computer could start. It loads datas which are then executed from RAM. I chose this topic because I would to know its function. I chose this website because it is straightforward and therefore easy to understand.

9. [Seek Time](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3558/seek-time#:~:text=Seek%20time%20is%20the%20time,move%20to%20the%20right%20position.)<br>
Seek time is the time taken for a controller on a hard disk to find some stored data. Seeking itself is the physical positioning or the read/write head of the disk. I chose this topic because I would to know when seek time happens. I chose this website because it is straightforward and therefore easy to understand.


10. [Rotational Latency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive_performance_characteristics#:~:text=Rotational%20latency%20(sometimes%20called%20rotational,revolutions%20per%20minute%20(RPM).)<br>
Rotational latency is the delay that happens while waiting for the rotation of the disk to bring the required disk sector on the read-write head. A disk is divided into many circular tracks that are also divided into sectors. I chose this topic because I would to know the parts of a disk to understand how rotational latency works and why it happens. I chose this website because it is straightforward and therefore easy to understand.
