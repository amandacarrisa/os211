# Top 10 list Week 10


1. [Serial Transmission](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-serial-and-parallel-transmission/)<br>
In Serial Transmission, data-bit flows from one computer to another computer in a bidirectional way. One bit flows during a clock pulse and 8 bits are transferred at a time. I chose this topic because I would like to know how data is transferred in a serial way. I chose this website because it is straightforward and therefore easy to understand.

2. [Parallel Transmission](https://www.quantil.com/content-delivery-insights/content-acceleration/data-transmission/#:~:text=There%20are%20two%20methods%20used,same%20time%20over%20multiple%20channels.)<br>
In Parallel Transmission, many bits are flow together simultaneously from one computer to another and this makes it faster than serial transmission. It is used for short distance.  I chose this topic because I would like to know how it differs from serial transmission. I chose this website because it is straightforward and therefore easy to understand.


3. [Direct memory access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_memory_access)<br>
DMA allows hardware subsystems to access main system memory/random access memory independent of the central processing unit (CPU). Without DMA, when a CPU is using programmed i/o, for the entire read/write operation it won't be able to perform other tasks. I chose this topic because I would like to know why DMA is useful. I chose this website because it is straightforward and therefore easy to understand.


4. [Buffering](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-spooling-and-buffering/)<br>
Buffering helps to compensate the speed of the data stream between the sender and the receiver. Buffer in itself is an area in the main memory to temporarily save data. I chose this topic because I would like to know why buffering is useful. I chose this website because it is straightforward and therefore easy to understand.

5. [Memory-mapped I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_I/O)<br>
In Memory-mapped I/O, it uses the same address space to handle memory and the I/O devices. The memory and registers of the I/O devices are mapped to some address values. I chose this topic because I would like to know how memory-mapping works. I chose this website because it is straightforward and therefore easy to understand.

6. [Port-mapped I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory-mapped_I/O)<br>
In Port-mapped I/O, it uses a class of CPU instructions that was made for performing I/O. It uses an address space and is accessed from a set of microprocessor instructions. I chose this topic because I would like to know how port-mapping works. I chose this website because it is straightforward and therefore easy to understand.

7. [Polling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_(computer_science))<br>
During polling, the computer waits for an external device to check whether it is ready or not. If an I/O operation is required the computer would still wait until a device is accessible. I chose this topic because I would like to know how polling works. I chose this website because it is straightforward and therefore easy to understand.

8. [Interrupt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polling_(computer_science))<br>
Interrupt is an event where a processor halts a task in order to do another needed task. During an interrupted process, it works by suspending the current task, saves the current state, and executes a function called an interrupt handler. I chose this topic because I would like to know how interrupt works. I chose this website because it is straightforward and therefore easy to understand.

9. [Application I/O Interface](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/applications-of-input-output-interface/)<br>
An interface is used for interpretting addresses that are generated by the CPU. It is used for communaction between the CPU and I/O devices. I chose this topic because I would like to know why an interface is needed. I chose this website because it is straightforward and therefore easy to understand.


10. [Asynchronous I/O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_I/O)<br>
Asynchronous I/O is a method of processing that allows other processes to continue before the transmission has finished. After the I/O process is completed, the results can be retreived. I chose this topic because I would like to know how asynchronous and synchronous I/O differ. I chose this website because it is straightforward and therefore easy to understand.
