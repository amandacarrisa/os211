# Top 10 list Week 05

1. [Buddy System Allocator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_memory_allocation)<br>
In this system memory blocks have an order from 0 to a specified upper limit. The size of a block of order n is proportional to 2^n and it makes computation simpler. I chose this for my top 10 because I never heard of this system and it has a unique name, I also want to learn it from this site because it is straightforward and I understand it better than from any other site

2. [Slab Allocator](https://www.kernel.org/doc/gorman/html/understand/understand011.html)<br>
Slab allocation is used to reduce fragmentation because of allocation/deallocation. Fragmentation is when a storage space is used inefficiently. A slab is a contiguous piece of the memory. It is the data container associated with objects of the cache. It's in my top 10 because I wanted to see how it differs from the buddy system and this site is simple and easy to understand

3. [Global Allocation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocation-frames/)<br>
In global allocation, a process brings a new page and gives a frame from a set of all of the frames. It can also take a frame that has an ongoing process. The advantage of it is that it does not disturb the process performance. It is in my top 10 because I want to see how global differs from local and what allocation means in this context and I chose this site because it provides a comparison from local allocation

4. [Local Allocation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocation-frames/)<br>
In local allocation, a process brings a new page and gives a frame from its own allocated frames. It differs from global because in global allocation the process can take a frame from a set of all the frames. It is in my top 10 because I want to see how it differs from global and what advantage it brings also I chose this site because it provides a comparison from global allocation

5. [Non-uniform memory access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_memory_access)<br>
NUMA is a memory design in which the memory access time depends on the memory location relative to the processor. A processor would access the local memory faster than non-local. The NUMA architecture explains that references to the addresses could differ in latencies because of where the data is stored. I chose this site because it explains in a simple language style that I understand and with the process as well.

6. [Non-uniform memory access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-uniform_memory_access)<br>
NUMA is a memory design in which the memory access time depends on the memory location relative to the processor. A processor would access the local memory faster than non-local. The NUMA architecture explains that references to the addresses could differ in latencies because of where the data is stored. It is in my top 10 because I want to learn how non-uniform operates and I chose this site because it explains in a simple language style that I understand and with the process as well.

7. [Working set model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_set)<br>
Working set model states that a process can be done in RAM only if all the pages it uses can also be in RAM. If the pages needed increases and there is no more space then the process is swapped out of the memory for other processes. It is in my top 10 because I wanted to know what working set means in the context of processes and I chose this site because I can understand this site better than others

8. [Thrashing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/techniques-to-handle-thrashing/)<br>
Thrashing is when the virtual memory resourecs are overused and paging and page faults happen oftenly. Thrashing makes the performance of a computer to fall. It is in my top 10 because I wanted to know what thrashing does and what impact it makes, and I chose this site because it uses an easy language style so I can understand better

9. [Page Fault](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-fault-handling-in-operating-system/)<br>
Page Fault is an event where a program wants to access data in its own address space but it is not the system RAM. I chose this site as it explains the process in bullet points so it is easy to understand and this topic is in my top 10 because I wanted to know what page faulting does.

10. [Page Replacement](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/page-replacement-algorithms-in-operating-systems/)<br>
Page Replacement is when the OS replaces pages with newly needed pages. There are few ways to do page replacements. The simplest one is FIFO, where the oldest page is front of the queue so replacement is done from the front of the queue. I chose this as my top 10 because I wanted to see why page replacement is done and the different ways of doing it. I chose this site because it lists all the ways of page replacement and explains in a simple understandable language.
